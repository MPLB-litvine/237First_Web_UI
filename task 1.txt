Task 1: Designing the web Front-End

There are 43 pages (components) to be designed and we will divide them as such:

- Jonathan designs 14 pages 
- Arrah designs 14 pages 
- Philip designs 15 pages

We will design in a chronological manner such that each page/activity links with the other.

Beginning with the Homepage which contains most of the links to the rest of the website.

The Homepage contains 4 tabs.
-Arrah should design the Timeline
-Jonathan should design the Browse music tab
-Philip should design the homepage tab

Each person will implement the css individually but we will correct and modify the code based on what we feel is the best look. 
Hint: You can use the design of another website as inspiration.

Note that this approach can change to meet our needs.

We have 2 weeks to complete this task.
